## ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to know :

#### üî∑ How does a virtual machine work ? And what its purpose ?
    
- **Virtualization** is the process of creating virtual versions of physical resources, such as servers, storage, networks, or applications. **The purpose of virtualization** is to optimize resource utilization, improve efficiency, and reduce costs by allowing multiple virtual systems or applications to run on a single physical hardware.
---
#### üî∑ Hypervisor ?

- **Hypervisor** is a software that can manage and create a virtual machine on your host and there is two types of hypervisor:
- **Type1 (bare metal)** : which is installed directly on top of your host
- **Type2** : which is installed on top of your operating system

#### üî∑ What's the difference between Debian and Rocky? and If you choose one on another explain why?
- soon ...
---
#### üî∑ What's a partition ? And more generally how does LVM (Logical Volume Management) work ?
- **Partition** is a logically divided section of a physical storage device 

- **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)** is a software-based system in Linux for **managing disk storage dynamically**. **LVM** is built into Linux

- With **LVM**, adding a new disk is easy, and the storage is managed as a unified pool. Logical Volumes can grow without needing to repartition or move data manually. Applications and users don‚Äôt notice any changes.

- With **Manual partitioning**, each new disk requires extra effort to partition, format, and mount. It often leads to fragmented storage, with data scattered across multiple locations, making management more complex as the system grows.
